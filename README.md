This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How To Use
It is a simple project that I made to practice my knowledge about React and NextJS, so this is simple to use.

First - You can add your friend's e-mail by clicking on START A NEW CHAT button.
Second - As your friend login too, you two will can talk each other, like you do using WhatsApp, but using your e-mails.
